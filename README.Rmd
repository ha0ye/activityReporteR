The goal of activityReporteR is to automate activity reporting that otherwise 
requires detailed recordkeeping and formatting. Functions are provided to 
download data from REDCap and GoogleSheets (since these are common sources of 
activity data already), and then format activities into appropriate text for 
reports.

## Installation

You can install the development version of activityReporteR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ha0ye/activityReporteR")
```
