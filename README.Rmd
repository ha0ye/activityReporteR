The goal of activityReporteR is to streamline the generation of activity reports and CV-like documents. Functions are provided to download and clean data from  REDCap and GoogleSheets (since these are sources for the author's own activities already), and then to format for insertion into a R markdown or Quarto document.

## Installation

You can install the development version of activityReporteR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ha0ye/activityReporteR")
