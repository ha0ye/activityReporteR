The goal of activityReporteR is to automate activity reporting that
otherwise requires detailed recordkeeping and formatting. Functions are
provided to download data from REDCap and GoogleSheets (since these are
common sources of activity data already), and then format activities
into appropriate text for reports.

## Installation

You can install the development version of activityReporteR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ha0ye/activityReporteR")
