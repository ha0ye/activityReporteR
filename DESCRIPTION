Authors@R: 
    person(given = "Hao",
           family = "Ye",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "hao.ye@weecology.org",
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0002-8630-1458"))
Description: Automate activity reporting that otherwise requires detailed recordkeeping and formatting. Functions are provided to download data from REDCap and GoogleSheets (since these are common sources of activity data already), and then format activities into appropriate text for reports.
